i hate how everytime i go to school everyone makes fun of my leapfrog tablet. Like, Idk if they know but Leapfrog is clearly the obvious choice over other alternatives like IPhones and Androids. My Leafrog tablet is MORE than a tablet, its my lifestyle. I wake up with it and I go to bed with it. It is my life, I dont need anything else. So go ahead and have your garbage smartphones, Ill be here playing go fish on my colorful Leapfrog Tablet. Thats another thing too. MY leapfrog tablet was made by the finest materials ranging from its thick plastic coating to its deep and powerful technology made from scratch. Using the latest processors and hardware, MY leapfrog tablet is powerful enough to do anything. My leapfrog tablet is better than all of you. It is better the the entire world combined and that what it means it me. It DOES mean the world to me. I praise my leapfrog tablet for whats its done for me. Its changed my life forever and has became my life, my love, My leapfrog tablet.
